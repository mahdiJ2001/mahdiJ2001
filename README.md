## About Me
I am a **Software Engineering** student with an interest in **distributed systems**, **software architecture**, and **Data Engineering**. I have gained practical experience through **two internships** at **fintech companies**. 

I enjoy solving complex problems and continuously learning new technologies. Additionally, I have a foundation in **mathematics** and physics, having completed two years of preparatory studies and earning my baccalaureate in mathematics.

## What I Can Provide

I have developed several **full-stack projects** using **Spring Boot** for the backend and **Angular/Next.js** for the frontend. I am capable of **dockerizing** these applications and managing the entire process from **design to dockerization** of the solution. My expertise allows me to deliver end-to-end solutions for complex projects.

I am highly adaptable and have no issues learning new technologies. I constantly strive to step out of my comfort zone and take on new challenges. Whether it’s doing **business research** for a project or quickly learning and applying new technologies, I am committed to continuous growth and improving my skill set. I pride myself on being able to **learn rapidly** and effectively integrate newly learned technologies into my work.
